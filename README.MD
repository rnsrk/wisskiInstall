# INSTALL WISSKI SCRIPT
This script installs a LAMP-Stack (Apache2, PHP, Mariadb) or complete missing parts on your Ubuntu 20.04 (or higher) and everything you need to start an install of the latest Drupal version (composer and drush). You can choose between a local development or production environment and you have the possibility to activate ssl support (manually or with certbot). WissKI and all necessary modules/ libraries could be downloaded. Just run the Drupal installer after the script has finished and activate required WissKI modules. Please keep in mind that WissKI needs a triple store to work.
## Usage
Just run `sudo ./install_wisski.bash` in your console.
