# INSTALL WISSKI SCRIPT
This script installs a LAMP-Stack (Apache2, PHP7.4, latest Mariadb) on your Ubuntu 20.04 machine and everything you need to start an install of the latest Drupal version (composer and drush). WissKI and all necessary modules/ libraries are downloaded and you have to activate them after your Drupal installation.
Just run `sudo ./install_wisski.bash` in your console.
