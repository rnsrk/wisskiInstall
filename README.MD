This script installs a LAMP-Stack (Apache2, PHP, latest Mariadb) on your Ubuntu 20.04 machine and everything you need to start an install of the latest Drupal version (composer and drush). You can choose between a local development or production environment and you have the possibility to activate https support. WissKI and all necessary modules/ libraries are downloaded and you have to activate them after your Drupal installation.
